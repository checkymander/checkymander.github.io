## Introduction
It seems cliche at this point, but just like every other offensive developer out there I wanted to try and create my own agent. The thing is though, I HATE creating UI's. I'm not great at it, I find writing the agent fun, I find writng the server fun, but actually making it look good is something I'm not interested in. So when @its_a_feature released Mythic as an agent agnostic c2 platform, it seemed like just the thing I was looking for. I get all the fun of creating a c2 agent, without any front end work!

When deciding on the agent, I had a few goals in mind. The first was that I wanted the agent to be cross-platform. That way I could use the agent whether I was on a Windows, Linux, or OSX box. Secondly, I wanted it to be modular, that way plugins could be loaded as needed and weren't directly compiled into the executable. Finally, I wanted it to be easy to develop for, I wanted to make cross-platform red team operations and development more accessible to the average red teamer.

As anyone who knows me will tell you, I'm a big fan of programming in C#. It's my preferred language, and when possible, I will always choose to write tools in that language. This comes with a pretty big downside however, I'm mostly limited to operating in Windows environments. Luckily for me, Microsoft <3 offsec and their new versions of .NET are all cross-platform! Red Teamers prefer older technologies, whether it's PowerShell v2, .NET 3.5/4.0 we don't normally like using the new sexy. New sexy contains security fixes, and those scare us. However, the benefits of the new versions of .NET were too good for me to pass up though, so I decided to stick with what I know, and write my agent in .NET 6.

##  What is Athena
![image](Athena image)
Athena is a fully-featured cross-platform agent designed using the .NET 6. It's designed to support Mythic 2.3 versions and will be updated to support new versions as they're released. As of this initial release it supports the following C2 Profiles:
- HTTP
- Websockets
- SMB (Beta, Windows Only)

In addition to the usual commands expected of an agent it supports the following:
- SOCKS5 Support (Beta)
- Hot loading of commands
- Cross-Platform execute-assembly functionality

## SMB Usage
There are two types of Athena payloads when it comes to SMB. There's payloads that contain the SMB Forwarder, and ones that don't. I included this so that operators have the flexibility to shrink down the payload size slightly when deploying agents, and to allow them more flexibility over the capability of their agents. Agents that don't contain the SMB forwarder will be unable to link up with Athena SMB agents, so if you were to attempt to use the `link` command, the agent will return an error.

In order to make use of the Athena SMB C2 profile, you'll need to generate an Athena payload, specifying SMB as your profile. This executable can then be run on a Windows machine, and will wait for a new connection. From an existing egress agent, you can then use the `link` command in order to connect to the agent.
`link <ip/host> <pipename>`

Once connected, you should see a successful check-in with the agent in the UI!

Currently named pipe communication only works between Windows hosts, but I'd like to explore the possibility of making them work on other platforms if it's possible.

## Commands
Athena supports the following commands:

| Command  | Description | Loadable? |
| ------------- | ------------- | |
| shell  | Run a shell command. | No |
| cat | Return the contents of a file  | Yes |

Commands that are marked `No` for loadable, are hardcoded into the agent and are unable to be hot-loaded (This may change in future updates).

## Reflection
Athena is designed to bring the reflection we all know and love to non-Windows platforms. An operator can create a .NET 6 DLL and compile it from their preferred development machine/pipeline. These DLLs can then be executed on any Athena agent, no matter the platform!

For example, you create an assembly called `Ping.dll` that attempts to ping a specified machine, and returns the result. You can develop and compile it on Windows, take the compiled DLL, and run it on your Linux Athena agent! There are some gotchas as certain functionality only supporting certain platforms (e.g. Windows Security Tokens), but for the most part any .NET DLLs coded in .NET Standard 2.0 or .NET 6 will work cross-platform with only a single compilation required!

Each module is loaded into its own AssemblyLoadContext which is the .NET 6 version of an AppDomain. This is nice because required third-party assemblies can be loaded into this AssemblyLoadContext without interfering with the main agent. Any assemblies that don't come in the standard Athena executable can be loaded with the `load-assembly` command. For example, if you were to create a directory enumeration plugin, that required the System.DirectoryServices nuget package, you could use load-assembly to load the System.Directoryservices DLL, which would then allow your plugin to execute properly with the `execute-assembly` command.

In order to preserve opsec all assemblies are loaded in-process, this does lead to some caveats:

### Long-Running assemblies are unable to be unloaded
Due to the way .NET 6 handles assebly loading, any assembly that never returns is forever stuck running. In order to kill the assembly, the entire agent will need to be killed. If you use the `jobkill` command the assembly will still be executing in the background
### One `execute-assembly` command can be run at a time
With most executables, instead of returning a string data type, they print to stdout, most c2 frameworks get around this limitation by using sacrificial processes and redirecting that processes output to an SMB pipe. Since everything is run in-process, we only have one std out and now real way to differentiate assemblies

## Things you should know
### Expect Bugs
This is my first attempt at a fully featured agent. I've attempted to identify and squash as many bugs as possible, however I expect more to be found.
### Compilation
I don't expect .NET 6 to be installed on anything by default anytime soon, because of this, I intended Athena to be compiled as a single-file, self-contained executable which results in a bit of a thick executable. In order to hopefully mitigated this issue, I've provided operators with flexible ways to compile Athena in order to lead to a file size that's more reasonable for them:

- Standard
	Athena is compiled as a standard executable without merging everything into one file. Useful when .NET 6 is already installed on your target machine
- Self-Contained
	Athena contains everything it needs to execute, useful when you're unsure if .NET 6 is already installed on the target machine
- Compressed
	Compresses the final executable, this can help decrease the file size significantly
- NativeAOT
	Uses the expiremental NativeAOT compilation method. This allows for Ahead of Time compilation, which allows the executable to run faster and decreases the final executable size, however you lose reflection capabilities
- Trimmed
	Assemblies that aren't necessary in order to run Athena are stripped away from the final payload. You will potentially encounter issues with execute-assembly and will need to load any assemblies that are needed manually, but built-in commands should work 

The table below provides a few of the common compilation methods along with the estimated compilation size:

| Compilation Method  | Description | Estimated Size |
| ------------- | ------------- | |
| Standard  | No special compilation, requires 3rd party libraries to be included | 67kb + 3rd party libraries |
| Self-Contained, Single File, Compressed (Default) | The standard self-contained compilation method, everything is included, final executable is compressed | 33mb |
| Self-Contained, Single File, Uncompressed | The standard self-contained compilation method, everything is included | 63mb |
| Self-Contained, Trimmed, Uncompressed | Unneeded assemblies are stripped out of final payload | 18mb |
| Self-Contained, Trimmed, Compressed | Unneeded assemblies are stripped out of final payload | 12.4mb |
| NativeAOT, Uncompressed | Use the experimental NativeAOT compilation method | 33mb |
| NativeAOT, Compressed | Use the experimental NativeAOT compilation method, compress final executable | 12.4mb |
